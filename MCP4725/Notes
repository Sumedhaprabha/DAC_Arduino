# DAC MCP4725

# 1. Uses the I2C communication module - where in we connect SCL to A5 and SDA to A4
# 2. A 12 bit DAC = 4095 steps , and if we are working with 5V it equals 1.2mV per step
# 3. Has an EEPROM to store the last value/ can continue from where it left.
# 4. I2C address at 0x62 - to change - connect addr to VCC(0x63) OR to GND (0x60) 
# 5. With fewer bits - resolution goes down
# 6. SCL - serial clock : controlled by the controller device - to clock data in/out
# 7. SDA - to transmit data to/from target device
# 8. A0 pin connected to VSS/VDD pins of the Arduino board for the I2C comm.
